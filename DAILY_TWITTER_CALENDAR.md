### Tweet 2 (1:00 PM KST) - Confidential Transactions
```
üí∞ CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTIONS EXPLAINED

Traditional blockchain: Everyone sees your balance üëÄ
ZK-powered blockchain: Prove valid transaction WITHOUT revealing amounts! ü§ê

Example:
‚ùå "Alice sent $500 to Bob"  
‚úÖ "Alice sent a valid amount to Bob"

Privacy preserved, security maintained! üîí

#ConfidentialTransactions #Privacy
```

### Tweet 3 (5:00 PM KST) - Scalable Verification
```
‚ö° SCALABLE VERIFICATION SYSTEMS

Problem: Verifying millions of transactions = slow ‚è≥
Solution: ZK proofs batch verification = instant! ‚ö°

Instead of checking 1M transactions individually:
‚Üí Generate 1 proof covering all 1M  
‚Üí Verify the single proof
‚Üí Confirm all 1M transactions valid

Scale without compromise! üìà

üè¢ ENTERPRISE ZK USE CASES

Real companies, real solutions:

üè¶ Banks: Prove compliance without revealing customer data
üè• Healthcare: Verify insurance without exposing medical records  
üõí Supply Chain: Confirm authenticity without revealing suppliers
üìä Analytics: Process data while maintaining privacy
